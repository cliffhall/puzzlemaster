I want to be able to maintain stock Plans, Roles, Teams, then when creating a project, I can add a stock Plan which has Phases with Teams and Agents ready to go.



Executing a Plan is a dashboard view where we can see the current Phase of the Plan, and each Agent's status as a card. Clicking on an Agent would cause it to go to a view where I could see all of the Agent's history and progress, and interact with that agent as it is running, giving it feedback to guide its progress.
